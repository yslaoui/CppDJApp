1
00:00:10.782 --> 00:00:14.500
Another factor that affects the way the
renderer renders the scene is perspective.

2
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.530
When we talk about perspective, again,

3
00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.710
we're talking about
the characteristics of the camera.

4
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.600
Once again, the sketches we saw up
until now had the default perspective.

5
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.551
Now we'll see how we can change
those default parameters.

6
00:00:29.551 --> 00:00:33.395
There are four characteristics of
the perspective, the field of view,

7
00:00:33.395 --> 00:00:36.300
the aspect ratio, the near plane,
and the far plane.

8
00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.840
The field of view is the extent
of the observable world

9
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.950
that is seen at any given moment.

10
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.050
And in this diagram,
it is the angle theta.

11
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.220
Here are two images taken from
the same location with two cameras.

12
00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.980
One camera had a field of
view of 55 degrees and

13
00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.480
the other one had a field of view of a 130
degrees, creating this wide angle view.

14
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.640
Humans have a field of view of 210
degrees on the horizontal axis.

15
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.210
And our vertical range
is about 150 degrees.

16
00:01:07.582 --> 00:01:10.644
In P5,
the default field of view is 60 degrees.

17
00:01:10.644 --> 00:01:14.612
The aspect ratio defines the aspect
ratio of the image, that is,

18
00:01:14.612 --> 00:01:18.580
the ratio between the width and
the height of view.

19
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.058
For example, here we have a 4:3 fullscreen
view and a 16:9 widescreen view,

20
00:01:23.058 --> 00:01:26.540
which are popular aspect ratios for
TV and cinema respectively.

21
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.060
In P5, usually you'd want it to be the
same aspect ratio as the canvas, that is,

22
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.160
width over height.

23
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.639
The far and near plane defines two planes
within which 3D objects are observable.

24
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.600
Something that goes beyond
the far plane is not visible.

25
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.740
Something that's nearer than near
plane is also not visible, and

26
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.610
therefore not rendered.

27
00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.740
In both cases,
these objects will be clicked.

28
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.750
Let's play with all these
in a live coding example.

29
00:01:56.703 --> 00:01:59.230
So let's look now into perspective.

30
00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.694
Again, I'm going to set up a default,
a little dummy scene

31
00:02:02.694 --> 00:02:07.254
there to highlight what's going on,
normalMaterial, something easy.

32
00:02:07.254 --> 00:02:11.377
And then I want to have some rods
that extend into the scene so

33
00:02:11.377 --> 00:02:17.030
that it's easy to see this clipping
thing that I want to show you later on.

34
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:24.016
So for (var i = -600;

35
00:02:24.016 --> 00:02:32.529
i<= 600; i+=150).

36
00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:39.270
So I want to make, I'll use push and
pop to place this rod.

37
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.116
So translate on the x axis by i, so

38
00:02:44.116 --> 00:02:49.828
I will start putting rods from -600

39
00:02:49.828 --> 00:02:54.169
to 600 at steps of 150.

40
00:02:54.169 --> 00:03:01.177
So 0, 150, sorry, 0 here because we're
translating, here box (80, 80, 500).

41
00:03:01.177 --> 00:03:05.975
So I'm going to be placing boxes that

42
00:03:05.975 --> 00:03:10.777
are 80 times 80 times 500.

43
00:03:10.777 --> 00:03:13.070
Run it, make sure that it compiles.

44
00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.080
Perfect, okay.

45
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.910
So I'm seeing these rods now.

46
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.840
Now, I have placed quite a few, but
I only see a small portion of them.

47
00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.740
So that's because of the camera view.

48
00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.291
So this is what I wanted to demonstrate.

49
00:03:30.291 --> 00:03:36.943
So now, the default camera, let's
actually lift the camera a tiny bit so

50
00:03:36.943 --> 00:03:42.523
that we can see everything
a little bit from higher position,

51
00:03:42.523 --> 00:03:48.130
height, 0, 0, so
still in the center, 0, 0, 1, 0.

52
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.655
So it's a camera that's
almost a default camera view,

53
00:03:51.655 --> 00:03:55.117
only it's a little bit higher and
it's looking down.

54
00:03:55.117 --> 00:03:58.546
So that's what we're getting now,
that's what we managed to get.

55
00:03:58.546 --> 00:04:01.560
Still, I can't fit
everything into the scene.

56
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:09.133
So that's because the perspective,
perspective, by default, is 60.

57
00:04:09.133 --> 00:04:11.675
Now, this won't work,
yeah, this ruined it,

58
00:04:11.675 --> 00:04:15.610
that's because, again, perspective,
we're talking about radians.

59
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.220
We want to make sure that
the language we're talking about

60
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.890
deals with it in degrees.

61
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.840
So angleMode(DEGREES), boom!

62
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:31.090
So by default, that's the view we have,
60 degrees point of view.

63
00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:37.045
So if I now make this,
let's say, 120, boom!

64
00:04:37.045 --> 00:04:40.780
It's like having a fish eye,
a wide angle lens, and seeing through it.

65
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.900
Actually, a fish eye would probably
be 180, let's see what that does.

66
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.782
Okay, that did something nasty.

67
00:04:49.782 --> 00:04:54.127
Yep, okay, so let's stick to 120.

68
00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:58.660
Let's leave this back to 60,
the default view.

69
00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.140
And now let's play with the next
parameters in perspective,

70
00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.750
which is the aspect ratio.

71
00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.978
Now, we said that by default,
it's width divided by height,

72
00:05:07.978 --> 00:05:11.144
so in this case, 900 over 600.

73
00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:13.270
So let's loot at that.

74
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.270
Nothing has changed.

75
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:22.715
Now, if I change this, so
now the ratio is 9 over 6, basically.

76
00:05:22.715 --> 00:05:27.430
Now, if I change this to
something like 4 over 4,

77
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.280
that is 1, so let's leave it 4 over 4.

78
00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:37.855
Look what I'm getting, it's rendering
things as if it was a square canvas,

79
00:05:37.855 --> 00:05:41.913
but the canvas is not square
because it's 900 by 600.

80
00:05:41.913 --> 00:05:44.010
And that's why it appears elongated.

81
00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.940
So if I change this manually to 900,
they appear correctly again.

82
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.500
So let's go back,
let's put that width over height.

83
00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.290
There's no reason to skew things.

84
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.510
And let's play now with
the final parameter,

85
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.820
which is the planes, which are the planes.

86
00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:09.670
So I'll just say that this
plane is controlled by mouseY,

87
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:13.380
this one is by mouseX.

88
00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:19.840
So actually,
let me just play with that for the moment.

89
00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.280
So if I just use,

90
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.290
the mouse now, mouseY,
is controlling the near plane.

91
00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:36.010
And you see that as the value increases
and I get further away from the camera,

92
00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:40.410
I get clipping, I clip the shape and
I see only half of it.

93
00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:46.543
And let me just make this, let's leave

94
00:06:46.543 --> 00:06:51.318
this as it is actually and do mouseX.

95
00:06:51.318 --> 00:06:53.970
And now mouseX controls
the far away plane.

96
00:06:53.970 --> 00:07:00.261
And sure enough, if I decrease
the value here, it's coming closer.

97
00:07:00.261 --> 00:07:05.260
So somewhere here, it's about zero.

98
00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.670
And because I have the other plane
as well, I can still see something.

99
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:11.170
But this is zero on the x-axis, so

100
00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:16.376
I'm clipping everything
further away from zero.

101
00:07:16.376 --> 00:07:18.710
And this is when I see the whole object.

102
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:22.780
So I can control now the two planes,
the far away and

103
00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:26.720
the near clipping plane,
with the mouseX and mouseY.

104
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.121
So this wraps up all the parameters
that go into perspective that control

105
00:07:30.121 --> 00:07:30.743
the camera.
