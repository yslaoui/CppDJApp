In this programming exercise, you’re asked to program a basic textured solar system in 3D just like in the image shown above. Use the code you have written in the previous solar system exercise as a starting point.

Steps to complete
Step 1: Load the appropriate texture on the sun using the assets provided in the attached zip file.

Step 2: Rotate the sun on its Y-axis.

Step 3: Load the appropriate texture on the earth using the assets provided in the attached zip file.

Step 4: Create a "stars plane" that is in the background of the scene and apply to it a dynamic texture (an off-screen buffer) which you have generated using the createGraphics() function. Remember to rotate your plane by 40 degrees or so, so that it faces the camera at the appropriate angle.

Step 5: Create an array called starLocs which you populate with 200 random locations on that buffer in your setup function.

Step 6: Write a function sky() that loops over starLocs and draws a small white rectangle in each location specified.

Step 7: Extend sky() so that it loops over starLocs and occasionally replaces an entry in the array with new random values. That way your stars will glitter on screen.

Bonus round: "Make it your own"
Add another planet that is full of craters which you have procedurally generated.

Add a moon. (Image of moon surface included in assets.)

How else could you extend the planetary system?
