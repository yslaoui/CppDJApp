## What is bubble sort?
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly comparing adjacent elements in an array and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. Bubble sort is a stable sorting algorithm, which means that it preserves the relative order of elements that are equal.

##  What is the time complexity of bubble sort?
The time complexity of bubble sort is O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because bubble sort has to compare every element in the array with every other element.

##  What is the space complexity of bubble sort?
The space complexity of bubble sort is O(1), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because bubble sort only needs to store a few temporary variables.

##  What are the advantages of bubble sort?
Bubble sort is a simple algorithm to understand and implement. It is also a stable sorting algorithm, which means that it preserves the relative order of elements that are equal.

##  What are the disadvantages of bubble sort?
Bubble sort is not a very efficient sorting algorithm. It has a time complexity of O(n^2), which means that it can be very slow for large arrays. Bubble sort is also not a very robust sorting algorithm. It can be easily disrupted by duplicate elements and elements that are already sorted.

##  When should bubble sort be used?
Bubble sort should be used when the following conditions are met:

Code snippet
* The array is small.
* The array is already sorted or contains mostly sorted elements.
* The stability of the sort is important.

Bubble sort should not be used when the following conditions are met:

Code snippet
* The array is large.
* The array is not already sorted or contains mostly unsorted elements.
* The speed of the sort is important.
