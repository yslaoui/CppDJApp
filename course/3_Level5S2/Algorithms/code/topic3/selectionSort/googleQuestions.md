ure, here are the answers to the questions on selection sort above in a Google interview:

## What is selection sort?
Selection sort is a sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly finding the minimum element in the unsorted subarray and swapping it with the first element in the unsorted subarray. Selection sort is not a stable sorting algorithm, which means that it does not preserve the relative order of elements that are equal.

## What is the time complexity of selection sort?
The time complexity of selection sort is O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because selection sort has to scan the entire unsorted subarray for each element that is swapped.

## What is the space complexity of selection sort?
The space complexity of selection sort is O(1), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because selection sort only needs to store a few temporary variables.

## What are the advantages of selection sort?
Selection sort is a simple algorithm to understand and implement. It is also a very efficient sorting algorithm for small arrays.

## What are the disadvantages of selection sort?
Selection sort is not a very efficient sorting algorithm for large arrays. It has a time complexity of O(n^2), which means that it can be very slow for large arrays. Selection sort is also not a very robust sorting algorithm. It can be easily disrupted by duplicate elements and elements that are already sorted.

## When should selection sort be used?
Selection sort should be used when the following conditions are met:

Code snippet
* The array is small.
* The speed of the sort is not important.
