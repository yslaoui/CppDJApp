Sure, here are the answers to the questions on insertion sort above in a Google interview:

## What is insertion sort?
Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly inserting the next element in the array into the correct position in the sorted subarray. Insertion sort is a stable sorting algorithm, which means that it preserves the relative order of elements that are equal.

##  What is the time complexity of insertion sort?
The time complexity of insertion sort is O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because insertion sort has to scan the entire sorted subarray for each element that is inserted.

##  What is the space complexity of insertion sort?
The space complexity of insertion sort is O(1), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because insertion sort only needs to store a few temporary variables.

##  What are the advantages of insertion sort?
Insertion sort is a simple algorithm to understand and implement. It is also a stable sorting algorithm, which means that it preserves the relative order of elements that are equal.

##  What are the disadvantages of insertion sort?
Insertion sort is not a very efficient sorting algorithm. It has a time complexity of O(n^2), which means that it can be very slow for large arrays. Insertion sort is also not a very robust sorting algorithm. It can be easily disrupted by duplicate elements and elements that are already sorted.

When should insertion sort be used?
Insertion sort should be used when the following conditions are met:

Code snippet
* The array is small.
* The array is already sorted or contains mostly sorted elements.
* The stability of the sort is important.

Insertion sort should not be used when the following conditions are met:

Code snippet
* The array is large.
* The array is not already sorted or contains mostly unsorted elements.
* The speed of the sort is important.
